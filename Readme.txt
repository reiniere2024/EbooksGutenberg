Hi All,

Ebooks-Gutenberg is a small program that I made to support my large
amount of free Gutenberg EBooks. These EBooks are made by the great 
Gutenberg-team based on classic books which are license free.
The Books can be downloaded from their website gutenberg.org

Many people consider these EBooks to be less interesting because of 
their age but that is a complete mistake since most of the important
classics are here from authors like Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky.
I download most of my EBooks from here, also Science Fiction books.

I made this program because it is not possible to search and browse
on the website in an effective way. My program contains the exact
EBook catalogue and you can search and browse through all books
and of course read and download them if you like.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to
move the maps XML and Database to the bin/debug directory when you
want to run the code.

Note:
The complete database with all EBooks from Gutenberg is 90MB and cant
be uploaded to Github. I therefor uploaded a database with only a small
part of the most recent EBooks. 

Good luck,
Reiniere.
